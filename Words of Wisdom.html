			<h1>Johnson's 5 Advice for Success!</h1>
			<p>
			</p><ol type="1" class="bigfont">
			<li> Work hard and work smart.<br>
			   Effort is crucial but knowing where to put the effort makes all the difference! 
			</li>

			<br><li> Never give up!<br>
			   Giving up means admitting failure. Imagine what would happen if Thomas Edison admit defeat on his last attempt before inventing the light bulb. 
			</li>

			<br><li> Learn from mistakes  &gt;.&lt;  <br>
			   Mistakes are not failures but hidden messages that lead to the road of success. It's okay to make many mistakes as long as you learn from them and never repeat them as the saying goes "once bitten twice shy".
			</li>

			<br><li>Be positive =)  <br>
			   When surrounded by enemies, a pessimistic soldier will think "We're surrounded! We're doomed!" An optimistic army will say "Great! We can shoot at all directions!". Behind every cloud is a silver lining.
			</li>

			<br><li> Treat others the way you want to be treated <br>
			   Not everyone will respect you in life but do not fret. Just give them the same amount of respect as you would like to receive. You'll never know what you'll acheive in the long run. What goes around comes around!
			</li>

			<br><h1>Johnson's 5 ways to pack on a road to Success</h1>
			<p class="faded">
			</p><ol type="I" class="bigfont">
			<li>Go above and beyond <br>
			   When someone asks you to complete a task, go one step further. It'll never hurt but help you build your future. When your teacher asks you to complete 5 out of 10 questions, why not complete them all?
			</li>

			<br><li> Never be afraid to ask questions<br>
			   When you don't understand a concept, it is wiser to ask now and get it answered. Most of the things that you'll be learning are build on what you learnt. Never accumulate questions but knowledge.
			</li>

			<br><li> Unleash your creativity<br>
			   When your teacher asks you to solve a problem, don't stop when you figure out a solution. Come out with several other approaches to tackle the problem from different perspectives. Always think outside the box.
			</li>

			<br><li> Divide and conquer<br>
			   When facing a tough problem, DO NOT PANIC! It may seem complicated on the surface but once you break it into smaller parts and understand what the question asks, you have acheived enlightenment.
            </li>

			<br><li> Be prepared!<br>
			   Most of us deal with problems only when we face it. It's best to plan ahead. Keep up with the news and think of what possible questions could arise from it as well as solutions to solve them. If you are lucky, you my even see the trend! If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.
			</li>

			<h2>My Blessing </h2>
			<p>
			Steve, as your elder brother I wish you all the best in your future. Exams are just part of your life and you'll have to learn to deal with it. No matter what the results are, as long as you put in your best effort in it, I am proud of you.<br><br> 

			This is my first time building a website and I dedicated it to you.<br><br>

			Good luck and make everyone who believes in you proud. As for those who doubted you, prove them wrong.
